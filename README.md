All developers working on the project do so in their free time, but the project has several expenses:
* Hackable   consoles to reverse-engineer the hardware
* Additional computer hardware for testing purposes (e.g. GPUs to diagnose graphical bugs, etc.)
* Licenses for various software development tools (e.g. Jetbrains, IDA)
* Web hosting and infrastructure maintenance (e.g. LDN servers)

All funds received through Patreon are considered a donation to support the project. Patrons receive early access to progress reports and exclusive access to developer interviews.
